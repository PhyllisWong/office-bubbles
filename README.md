## Let's get going
After cloning the repo, give this baby one of these bad boys:

```
npm install
```

Great. Then to start up the server, give it one of these:

Yarn Users:
```
yarn start
```

NPM Users:
```
npm start
```

And then you will be live on localhost:3000. Awesome.

## Contributing
I will gladly accept contributions. Feel free to burst my bubble.
